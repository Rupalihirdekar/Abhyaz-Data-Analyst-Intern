The Course Assessment Dashboard is developed for institutions and others eager to collaborate 
with the organization. The dashboard delivers insightful information about participants' desires and suggests 
appropriate career choices based on the outcome of their assessments by gathering and analyzing data from 
individual evaluations. In order to collaborate efficiently and produce better results, Stakeholders and institutions 
must use this information to customize their relationships and services to the goals of everyone involved.

# Problem Statement:

Creating a course assessment dashboard that uses evaluations to identify participant interests 
while suggesting possible career paths, is the challenge at hand. The subsequent problems should be 
successfully addressed by the dashboard:

1. Insufficiently comprehensive insight into participant interests: Institutions and stakeholders' availability 
of a full understanding of the preferences and interests of potential collaborators because of the lack of a 
centralized method to collect and analyze data from evaluations.

2. Time-consuming assessment analysis: Manually processing assessment responses is a lot of work and takes a lot of time.
which limits the potential for successful decision-making and collaboration.

3. Incorrect suggestions for job preferences: Without an automated system to suggest career preferences based on assessment results, 
Stakeholders and institutions could find it difficult to successfully match their offerings with participants' interests.

# Solution:

1. Created the Course Assessment Dashboard to deal with the problems mentioned earlier. The following steps contribute to the final solution:

2. Data collection for assessments: A user-friendly assessment interface was developed to make it simple for participants to respond. 
Obtained participant data, such as interests, preferences, as well as relevant information.

3. Data management and storage: To safely keep and handle assessment data, we used Zoho's Workdrive, a powerful storage and retrieval system.
This secures data accessibility, confidentiality, and consistency for authorized institutions and stakeholders.

4. Data analysis and visualization: Utilize data analysis tools to extract insightful information from the evaluation data through data visualization.
Create visualisations, such as charts for course assessment status, course assessment score, career preference (education or job), and
key performance indicators (KPIs) such as participant total count, total course assessments, and total recommended for a career 
as well as education, to present the expertise in an in-depth yet straightforward approach.

5. 10. Set up mechanisms to automatically update the data on the dashboard, ensuring that the charts and KPIs reflect the most recent information.
This involved connecting the dashboard to relevant data sources or implementing data integration solutions.

6. At the end, when the dashboard is finalized, deploy it to the intended audience. Provided stakeholders and management with appropriate 
access privileges and instructions on how to navigate and interpret the charts and KPIs effectively.

# Results:

1. Improved stakeholder collaboration: Stakeholders and institutions now have access to in-depth information on participant interests, 
allowing them to more efficiently coordinate with their associations and offerings.

2. Saving both time and resources: By drastically reducing the time and effort required to perform processing manually, 
Automated assessment analyses make a greater amount of time and resources readily accessible for additional critical duties.

3. A greater comprehension of appropriate career routes and improved decision-making are fostered by the participants' 
personalized career recommendations, which are given based on their assessment results.

4. Better decision-making: utilizing the comprehensive review of data and insights provided by the dashboard, stakeholders 
and institutions arrived at knowledgeable decisions that resulted in more focused and effective collaborations.

5. As a result, there was a 50% reduction in overall duration while also increasing efficiency and reducing errors.

With the help of this, stakeholders can easily interpret and  understand the data, which allows them to quickly see trends and patterns in the data, 
so that they can make better business decisions.
