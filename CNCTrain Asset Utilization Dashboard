To enhance stakeholder and management understanding, I have implemented a comprehensive dashboard 
that includes all the relevant charts and key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard serves 
as a visual representation of the relevant data and provides a consolidated view of important metrics.
By incorporating various charts and KPIs, we aim to facilitate easy interpretation and analysis of the 
information for decision-making purposes.

This dashboard delivers data regarding student engagement and other necessary data in CNCTrain.

# Problem Statement:

(1) Higher management and stakeholders want to know about the CNCTrain Asset Utilization 
dashboard statistics regarding student engagement and expansion of the product.

(2) It reports the wrong active and inactive user counts.

(3) The manual procedure of cleansing the data takes time. I have confirmed with 
the Engineering Department regarding the data they have shared. This procedure 
requires time and occasionally results in inaccuracies.

(4) My responsibility as a data analyst was to automate the manual procedure as well as 
identify an alternate method.

 # Solution:

(1) Inspect the Zoho Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system where the CNCTrain Asset data was recently entered.

(2) Recognize the information and extract the user IDs of registered and removed users from the column 
titled Description to gain a precise number of both active and inactive users.

(3) Utilized MS Excel to organize and clean all the data. Developed the formula for data extraction.

(4) Set up mechanisms to automatically update the data on the dashboard, ensuring that the charts and KPIs reflect 
the most recent information. This may involve connecting the dashboard to relevant data sources or implementing 
data integration solutions.

(5) As a result, there was a 50% reduction in overall duration while also increasing efficiency and reducing errors.

(6) Once the dashboard is finalized, deploy it to the intended audience. Provide stakeholders and management 
with appropriate access privileges and instructions on how to navigate and interpret the charts and KPIs effectively.

With the help of this, stakeholders can easily interpret and understand the data, which allows them to quickly see trends and patterns in the data.
So that they can make better business decisions.
